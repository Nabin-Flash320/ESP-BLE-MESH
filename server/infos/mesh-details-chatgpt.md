# (Q) Provide details about ble mesh nwtoerk, from service, characteristics, UUIds used, payload structures, provisioning mechanism and data transmission mechanism


### **Bluetooth Mesh Network Overview**  

Bluetooth Mesh (BLE Mesh) is a low-power, scalable networking standard based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It allows many-to-many (m:m) device communication, making it ideal for smart lighting, industrial automation, and IoT applications.  

---

## **1. BLE Mesh Network Components**  

### **Nodes**  
- **Provisioned Node**: A device that has been added to a BLE Mesh network.  
- **Unprovisioned Device**: A new device that is waiting to be added to the network.  
- **Relay Node**: A node that can retransmit messages to extend network range.  
- **Friend Node**: Stores messages for low-power nodes.  
- **Low-Power Node (LPN)**: A device that remains in sleep mode and periodically communicates with a friend node.  

---

## **2. BLE Mesh Provisioning Mechanism**  
Provisioning is the process of securely adding a device to a BLE Mesh network.  

### **Provisioning Process Steps**  
1. **Beaconing**: The unprovisioned device advertises its availability using the `Mesh Beacon` (UUID: `0x1827`).  
2. **Invitation**: A provisioner (e.g., a smartphone) sends a **Provisioning Invite PDU** to start provisioning.  
3. **Capabilities Exchange**: The unprovisioned node sends a **Provisioning Capabilities PDU**, including cryptographic capabilities.  
4. **Public Key Exchange**: The node and provisioner exchange public keys (if using OOB authentication).  
5. **Authentication**: The device may require input (e.g., pressing a button) or display a code.  
6. **Session Key Generation**: A secure session key is derived using ECDH.  
7. **Data Distribution**: The provisioner sends network keys (NetKey), unicast addresses, and other provisioning data.  
8. **Completion**: The node joins the mesh network as a provisioned node.

## **3. BLE Mesh GATT Services and Characteristics**  

| **Service/Characteristic**   | **UUID**      | **Purpose** |
|------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Mesh Proxy Service           | `0x1828`      | Used for communication between GATT-based devices and the Mesh network. |
| Mesh Provisioning Service    | `0x1827`      | Handles the provisioning of new devices. |
| Mesh Proxy Data In           | `0x2ADD`      | Handles incoming mesh messages for Proxy nodes. |
| Mesh Proxy Data Out          | `0x2ADE`      | Sends mesh messages from a Proxy node. |

### **Proxy and GATT Communication**
- Devices like smartphones use **Mesh Proxy Service (0x1828)** to communicate with mesh nodes.  
- The **Mesh Proxy Protocol** is used to relay messages from GATT devices to the Mesh network.  

---

## **4. BLE Mesh Network Security**  

### **Keys in BLE Mesh**
- **NetKey (Network Key)**: Encrypts messages at the network layer.
- **AppKey (Application Key)**: Encrypts messages at the application layer.
- **Device Key**: Used during provisioning for encryption.
- **IV Index**: Prevents replay attacks.

Each message has a **Network Layer Encryption** and an **Application Layer Encryption** for security.

---

## **5. BLE Mesh Communication & Payload Structure**  

### **Message Structure**  
BLE Mesh messages are sent using the **Lower Transport Layer** (segmentation and reassembly) and **Upper Transport Layer** (encryption).  

```
+---------------------+
|  Network PDU       |  -> Contains NetKey, TTL, Source & Destination Addresses.
+---------------------+
|  Transport PDU     |  -> Includes segmented or unsegmented messages.
+---------------------+
|  Access PDU        |  -> Contains the actual opcode and parameters.
+---------------------+
```

### **Message Types**
| **Message Type** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Unicast** | Sent to a specific node address. |
| **Group** | Sent to a group of nodes (e.g., all lights in a room). |
| **Broadcast** | Sent to all nodes in the network. |

### **Example Access Layer Payload (Vendor Model)**
```
Opcode (3 bytes) | Parameter 1 | Parameter 2 | Parameter 3 ...
```
- **Opcode**: Identifies the type of message.
- **Parameters**: Data such as sensor values or status information.

---

## **6. BLE Mesh Models (SIG and Vendor-Specific Models)**  

### **SIG Models (Standard Models)**
| **Model Name** | **Model ID** | **Function** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Generic OnOff Server | `0x1000` | Controls a simple on/off state. |
| Generic OnOff Client | `0x1001` | Sends on/off commands. |
| Generic Level Server | `0x1002` | Handles values like brightness. |
| Sensor Server | `0x1100` | Reports sensor data. |
| Health Server | `0x0002` | Monitors node health. |

### **Vendor-Specific Models**
- Custom models for device-specific functionality.
- Example:
  ```
  Vendor Model ID: 0x1234
  Vendor Opcode: 0xC1
  ```

---

## **7. BLE Mesh Data Transmission Mechanism**  

### **Sending a Message (Unicast Example)**
1. The sender constructs an **Access Layer PDU** with the opcode and data.
2. The message is encrypted with the **AppKey**.
3. The message is packed into a **Transport PDU** and optionally fragmented.
4. The **Network Layer** adds addresses, TTL, and encrypts it with **NetKey**.
5. The message is transmitted and relayed by **Relay Nodes** if needed.
6. The destination node decrypts the message and processes it.

### **Receiving a Message**
- The node decrypts the message with **NetKey** and **AppKey**.
- If it's a **relayed message**, the TTL (Time to Live) value is decremented before forwarding.
- The application processes the **opcode** and payload.

---

## **8. Friend and Low Power Node (LPN) Mechanism**
LPNs save power by sleeping most of the time and only waking to communicate with **Friend Nodes**.

- **LPN Requests**: Asks the Friend Node to store messages.
- **Friend Node Caching**: Stores messages and delivers them when the LPN wakes up.
- **Power Saving**: LPNs only wake at defined intervals.

---

## **9. BLE Mesh Relay and Network Scalability**
- **Relay Nodes** forward messages beyond a single device's range.
- **TTL (Time to Live)** determines the number of hops a message can take.
- **Subnet Keys** allow devices to communicate across different networks securely.

---

## **10. Example BLE Mesh Vendor Model Message**
A custom vendor model message for controlling an LED could look like this:

```
Opcode: 0xC1 (Vendor)
Company ID: 0x1234
Data: 0x01 (LED ON)
```
- The message is encrypted, packed into a **Network PDU**, and transmitted.
- The receiver decrypts, extracts the **Opcode**, and executes the LED command.

---

## **Conclusion**
BLE Mesh is a powerful protocol for large-scale IoT applications, offering **scalability, security, and power efficiency**. By leveraging **Provisioning, Relay Nodes, Friend Nodes, and Vendor Models**, developers can build **robust** wireless systems.

# (Q) Provide detailed information about proivisioning packt structure, opcodes and packet size and packet divisionins in provisioining packet and mesh mesage packet

## **BLE Mesh Provisioning and Message Packet Structure**  

BLE Mesh communication follows a structured format in provisioning and message packets. Below is a **detailed breakdown** of provisioning packet structure, opcodes, packet sizes, and divisions in both provisioning and mesh message packets.

---

# **1. Provisioning Packet Structure**  
Provisioning is the process of adding a new device (unprovisioned node) to the BLE Mesh network. This process follows the **PB-ADV** (Advertising Bearer) or **PB-GATT** (GATT Bearer) methods.

### **1.1 Provisioning PDU (Protocol Data Unit) Structure**
Each provisioning message consists of **Provisioning PDUs**, which are transmitted in multiple segments if they exceed the BLE MTU size.

| **Field**        | **Size (Bytes)** | **Description** |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| `Transaction Start` | 1 | Identifies start of provisioning data |
| `PDU Type`         | 1 | Type of provisioning PDU |
| `Payload`         | Varies | Provisioning data |
| `MIC`             | 4 | Message Integrity Check |

### **1.2 Provisioning PDU Types and Structure**
Each provisioning message follows a specific format based on its type.

| **PDU Type** | **Opcode** | **Size (Bytes)** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Invite | `0x00` | 1 | Starts provisioning, sets Attention Timer |
| Capabilities | `0x01` | 11 | Sent by device, lists capabilities |
| Start | `0x02` | 5-6 | Starts provisioning process |
| Public Key | `0x03` | 64 | Exchanges public key for authentication |
| Input/Output | `0x04` | Variable | Sends authentication value |
| Confirmation | `0x05` | 16 | Confirms the exchange of authentication |
| Random | `0x06` | 16 | Provides random value for authentication |
| Data | `0x07` | 33 | Contains network and security keys |
| Complete | `0x08` | 0 | Signals end of provisioning |
| Failed | `0x09` | 1 | Error code if provisioning fails |

---

# **2. Packet Division in Provisioning**  
Since the **maximum BLE advertisement payload is 31 bytes**, provisioning packets are **split into multiple fragments** when necessary.

### **Provisioning Packet Fragmentation**
- If a provisioning message **exceeds 20 bytes** (typical MTU), it is fragmented.
- Each segment follows **SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly)** rules.
- A **start bit**, **continuation bit**, and **end bit** are used to track the segments.

| **Segment Type** | **Header (1 Byte)** | **Max Payload (Bytes)** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Start Segment | `0b00xxxxxx` | 19 |
| Continuation | `0b01xxxxxx` | 20 |
| End Segment | `0b10xxxxxx` | Remaining |

For example, the **Provisioning Data PDU (33 bytes)** requires **two packets**:
1. **First packet:** 19 bytes (`Start`)
2. **Second packet:** 14 bytes (`End`)

---

# **3. BLE Mesh Message Packet Structure**
Once provisioning is complete, nodes communicate using BLE Mesh **network messages**. The **network packet structure** consists of **lower transport, upper transport, access, and application layers**.

### **3.1 Network PDU Format**
| **Field** | **Size (Bits)** | **Description** |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| PDU Type | 2 | Identifies message type (Network, Access, Control) |
| TTL | 8 | Time-to-live (hops) |
| Seq | 24 | Sequence number to prevent replay attacks |
| SRC | 16 | Source address |
| DST | 16 | Destination address |
| Transport PDU | Variable | Mesh transport layer data |
| MIC | 32 | Message Integrity Check |

---

# **4. Opcode and Payload Structure in Mesh Messages**
Mesh messages contain **opcodes** that identify the type of command sent. Opcodes can be **SIG (Standard) or Vendor-Specific**.

### **4.1 SIG Model Opcodes**
| **Opcode (Hex)** | **Message Type** | **Payload Size** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `0x8201` | Generic On/Off Set | 2-3 |
| `0x8202` | Generic On/Off Status | 1 |
| `0x8203` | Generic Level Set | 3-5 |
| `0x8204` | Generic Level Status | 2 |
| `0x8205` | Generic Default Transition Time Set | 1 |
| `0x8206` | Generic Default Transition Time Status | 1 |

### **4.2 Vendor Model Opcodes**
| **Opcode (Hex)** | **Message Type** | **Payload Size** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `0xC10000` | Vendor Message | Variable |

- Vendor-specific messages use **3-byte opcodes**.
- SIG messages use **1 or 2-byte opcodes**.

---

# **5. BLE Mesh Data Transmission Mechanism**
### **5.1 Lower Transport Layer**
Messages are divided into **segments** based on their size:
- **Unsegmented Message:** Up to **15 bytes** (SIG models) or **12 bytes** (Vendor models).
- **Segmented Message:** Messages exceeding these sizes use **segmentation and reassembly**.

### **5.2 Upper Transport Layer**
- Adds encryption and authentication.
- Uses **Network Key (NetKey) and Application Key (AppKey)** for security.

### **5.3 Reliable vs. Unreliable Messages**
| **Message Type** | **ACK Required?** | **Usage** |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Acknowledged (Reliable) | Yes | Generic On/Off Set, Level Set |
| Unacknowledged (Unreliable) | No | Status Messages, Generic On/Off Set Unack |

---

## **Conclusion**
BLE Mesh provisioning and message packet structures ensure secure, efficient communication using:
- **Segmented Provisioning PDUs**
- **Provisioning Opcode-based messaging**
- **BLE Mesh Network PDU fragmentation**
- **Reliable and Unreliable Transmission Mechanisms**
